# Spacelaunch News API
Spacelaunch News API was created as a solution for my problem when I wanted to develop an app for Spaceflight News: many (great!) news sites with different API's.

To make it easier for myself, I began a project that would aggegrate metadata from those news sites and publish them through an API. Since there are others that might benefit from this API, I decided make the API publicly available.

There are great apps out on the internet, that are connected to services like <https://www.launchlibrary.net/>. By making this API available to everyone, I hope to open new doors for the developers of these apps.

## Version 2
In Juli 2020, Launch Library 2.0 was released, within the new The Space Devs group. I've joined this group as a partner developer, and started finalizing SNAPI 2.0.

Version 2.0 of SNAPI is a rewrite of the enitre API. It's using the amazing Strapi as a backend, with custom endpoints written by me.
SNAPI 2 sets the stage for new features to come. 2.0 focuses on bringing the existing features to the new format.


## Launch Library 2 integration
Starting from version 2, we now have Launch Library 2 integration. This way you can easily get news related to a specific launch.
A nice to have if you want to have a "related news/launches" section in your app!
