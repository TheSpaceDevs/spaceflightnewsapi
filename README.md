# Spaceflight News API

The Spaceflight News API was created as a solution for my problem when I wanted to develop an app for Spaceflight News: many (great!) news sites with different APIs.

To make it easier for myself, I began a project that would aggregate metadata from those news sites and publish them through an API. Since there are others that might benefit from this API, I decided make the API publicly available.

There are great apps out on the internet, that are connected to services like <https://thespacedevs.com>. By making this API available to everyone, I hope to open new doors for the developers of these apps.

## Documentation 📖

The documentation is generated from the code, and can be found at <https://api.spaceflightnewsapi.net/v4/documentation>.

## Evolution 📈

### Version 2

In July 2020, Launch Library 2.0 was released, within the new <a href="https://thespacedevs.com">The Space Devs API</a> group. I've joined this group as a partner developer, and started finalizing SNAPI 2.0.

Version 2.0 of SNAPI is a rewrite of the entire API using Strapi as a backend, with custom endpoints written by me.
SNAPI 2 sets the stage for new features to come and focuses on bringing the existing features to the new format.

### Version 3

In the Spring of 2021, Strapi announced that they would retire support for MongoDB. Since SNAPI was using MongoDB as the database, this had quite a big impact.
Version 3 of the API is exactly the same as version 2 (in terms of the response), except the IDs. These changed from ObjectIDs (strings) to integers.

### Version 4
In 2023 SNAPI V4 launched, completely re-written in Python (Django) for various reasons.
Using proven libraries, this version is focussed on long-term stability and maintainability.

## Launch Library 2 integration 🚀

Starting from version 2, we now have <a href="https://thespacedevs.com/llapi">Launch Library 2 API</a> integration. This way you can easily get news related to a specific launch.
A nice to have if you want to have a "related news/launches" section in your app!
