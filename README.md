# Spacelaunch News API
Spacelaunch News API was created as a solution for my problem when I wanted to develop an app for Spaceflight News: many (great!) news sites with different API's.

To make it easier for myself, I began a project that would aggegrate metadata from those news sites and publish them through an API. Since there are others that might benefit from this API, I decided make the API publicly available.

There are great apps out on the internet, that are connected to services like https://www.launchlibrary.net/. By making this API available to everyone, I hope to open new doors for the developers of these apps.
