# Spaceflight News API

Spaceflight News API was created as a solution for my problem when I wanted to develop an app for Spaceflight News: many (great!) news sites with different API's.

To make it easier for myself, I began a project that would aggegrate metadata from those news sites and publish them through an API. Since there are others that might benefit from this API, I decided make the API publicly available.

There are great apps out on the internet, that are connected to services like <https://thespacedevs.com/>. By making this API available to everyone, I hope to open new doors for the developers of these apps.

## Documentation

The documentation is generated from the code, and can be found at <https://api.spaceflightnewsapi.net/v3/documentation>.

## Version 2

In Juli 2020, Launch Library 2.0 was released, within the new The Space Devs group. I've joined this group as a partner developer, and started finalizing SNAPI 2.0.

Version 2.0 of SNAPI is a rewrite of the enitre API. It's using the amazing Strapi as a backend, with custom endpoints written by me.
SNAPI 2 sets the stage for new features to come. 2.0 focuses on bringing the existing features to the new format.

## Version 3

In the Spring of 2021, Strapi announced that they would retire support for MongoDB. Since SNAPI was using MongoDB as the database, this had quite a big impact.
Version 3 of the API is exactly the same as version 2 (in terms of the response), except the ID's. These changed from ObjectID's (strings) to integers.

## Version 4
In 2023 SNAPI V3 launched, completely re-written in Python (Django) for various reasons.
Using proven libraries, this version is focussed on long-term stability and maintainability.

## Launch Library 2 integration

Starting from version 2, we now have Launch Library 2 integration. This way you can easily get news related to a specific launch.
A nice to have if you want to have a "related news/launches" section in your app!
